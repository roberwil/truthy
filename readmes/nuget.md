# Truthy

### What is truthy anyway?

Well, think of a truth table you just invented, you put your 1s and 0s and **Truthy** figures out which formula works
for the table.

| A   | B   | C   |
|-----|-----|-----|
| 0   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 0   | 1   |
| 1   | 1   | 0   |
| 0   | 1   | 0   |

If you create the above table with **Truthy**, it will know what to do so that your table makes sense.
Also, **Truthy** has implementations for the following logical gates: `and`, `or`, `not`,
`xor`, `nand`, `nor`, `xnor` and a special `or`.

### Where can I use it?

- Access matrices are a good example;
- Other examples are just day-to-day comparisons you do with booleans in your code.

Let your imagination make good use of Truthy.

### Where do I learn how to use it?

Check the documentation [here](https://github.com/roberwil/truthy/blob/main/README.md).
Remember, **Truthy** is the way.
